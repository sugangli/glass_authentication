The recent years have seen a significant growth in popularity of
smart wearable devices. This growth can be attributed to the advances in
hardware miniaturization technology as well as economically affordable
and energy efficient sensing and computing. While size, energy and cost
constraints remain key motives for improvements in wearable computers'
design, the aspect of user authentication has received relatively less
attention. Wearable devices often collect and store sensitive data about
users, and thus there is an obvious need to authenticate the right user to the
device. Solutions today primarily rely on indirect authentication
mechanisms through the user's smartphone, which can be cumbersome and less secure. Biometric based solutions, though
very effective, however, are subject to the availability of the specific
sensors in the wearable unit. In this paper, we propose to authenticate
wearable devices to users based on their unique behavioral patterns. In
particular, we prototype an authentication system, dubbed {\em Headbanger} for
wearable devices by
monitoring user's unique head-movement patterns in response to an external
audio stimulus. Using a personal imaging device as a running example and
through extensive experimental evaluation over multiple users we show
that our mechanism can authenticate users with an acceptance rate greater than
95.1\% while keeping the average false rejection rate below 3.9\%.
