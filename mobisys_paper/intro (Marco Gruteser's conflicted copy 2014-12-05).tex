We live in a world that has seen a generation of technological revolutions;
from wired to wireless communications, immovable to mobile machines, large
sized to hand-held devices. Today, we are witnessing what can be deemed as the
next phase of mobile revolution through {\em wearable computers}. Research in
wearable computers can be dated back to as early as 1980s when Steve Mann
developed a prototype heads-up-display goggles~\cite{}. Thanks to the 
advances in hardware miniaturization technology, cheap sensors/processor 
chips, and low-power sensing/computing, today, wearables are available 
off-the-shelf and have almost become an integral part of human 
lives~\cite{googleglass,smart-watch, fitbit}. 

%This is clearly evident from the surge in the number and types of wearables 
%that are commercially available -- ranging from smart glasses, smart 
%necklaces, smart wristbands, to smart watches.
The surge in wearables is clearly seen in commercially through the array of 
smart wearable devices seeping fast into the market. Research on wearables has 
actively picked up and is progressing over the day. Keeping in mind the 
resource limitations on wearable computers research so-far has primarily 
been addressing three key optimization parameters in 
design: size, energy and cost. With the onset of proliferation of wearable 
devices, in the recent times the aspect of security and privacy have also been 
adding key concerns to wearable computer usage.
A solution for safeguarding the security and privacy of user's data on the 
wearable device is only effective as long as the device itself is 
authenticated to the right user/owner.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent{\bf Authentication Challenge.}
%User-authentication for wearable devices has so-far received relatively less
%attention; commercially as well as in research. 
Authentication on most commercially available wearable devices
today~\cite{fitbit, smartwatch} relies on an indirect mechanism, where users
can login to their wearables through their phones. This requires the wearable
device to be registered and paired to the user's mobile device, which makes it
inconvenient as the user has to carry both the devices. The security of this 
approach is also in question as it increases the chance of hacking into the 
both the devices if either of the devices are lost or stolen. 
Some devices including Google Glass~\cite{googleglass} and 
FitBit''s health tracker~\cite{fitbit}, pair the device to the users email
account instead of the phone for user's convenience, however, does not add any 
security benefit. Though wearable devices today almost contain the same suite 
of sensors as a smartphone, the computing capacity and battery lifetime of 
wearables are far less comparable. This implies that, translating the same 
an authentication solution from a phone to the wearable device, to enable 
direct authentication, is not only undesirable but also impractical.
Thus, the need for the day is a simple, low-power, and accurate
direct authentication solution.
%For example, fitness trackers~\cite{} and
%smart-watches~\cite{} are tethered to user's mobile device to connect to the
%Internet as well as for remote data collection.
There have also been a few specific point solutions that propose to directly
authenticate the user to the device using biometric signatures~\cite{mobisys 
papers,etc}. However, collecting and recognizing these biometrics is subject 
to the availability of the sensing hardware and the computing capability on 
the wearable units, hence unrealistic in most 
cases. The recent years have also seen a significant interest in using 
behavioral characteristics of humans as biometric signatures for mobile phone 
authentication~\cite{stevenage1999visual,okumura2006study,monrose2000keystroke,jorgensen2011mouse,bo2013silentsense,de2012touch}.
For example, human walking gait, arm swings, typing patterns, body pulse 
beats, eye-blinks have all been found to be distinctive in human beings. 
The main advantage of using behavioral biometrics is that the signatures can 
be generated from raw data of basic sensor that are inbuilt in mobile phones 
such as motion sensors, camera, microphones etc.
However, what behavioral biometric remains the best suited for a wearable 
device and if such a biometric can be captured by the wearable device lays a 
fundamental question for a system that may adopt this approach. 

\vspace{1mm}\noindent{\bf Head-movement based authentication.}
In this paper, we propose to authenticate wearable devices to users based on 
their unique behavioral patterns. Keeping in mind the feasibility of 
implementation and the availability of the sensor on the wearable device, 
we design a system that authenticates users to their device directly through 
their head-movement patterns.
In particular, we prototype an authentication system, dubbed {\em Headbanger},
that generates a signature from user's head-movements that serves as the 
behavioral biometric for authentication. To ensure the user makes while the 
beats and 
rhythm from the 
audio will 
act as the
stimulus. We generate the signatures from the head-movements from the
accelerometer raw signal data. While we use a Google Glass a running example
for the wearable device, our design can be applied to other head-worn gadgets
or even any system that can record head-movements.

for example, almost all head-worn wearables, that include personal imaging 
devices, gaming headsets, AI devices, have an accelerometer and gyroscope
sensor. Unlike physiological biometrics that require custom hardware,
behavioral biometrics offer a much more available/conveient solution. The challenge, however,
is to ensure that these patterns are repeatable under all circumstances that
the user encounters as well as the differentiability factor between different
human beings. %We show that by using the same external stimulus among all users
%the baseline for comparison is achieved much easier and the head-patterns are
%more consistent and differentiable among users.

After studying accelerometer data during head-movements for *** people, we 
find that head-movements are distinctive between different users, hard to 
imitate by others, and repeatable for the same user. First, for a simple 
nodding movement, our Headbanger system can successfully reject imitators 
***\% of the time. Second, same user's movement can be successfully accepted 
***\% of the time. As a result, we believe head-movement, though simple, can 
serve as a reliable behavioral biometric to authenticate users to wearable 
devices. 

%Subconscious head-movement, or any body movement as a matter
%of fact, can be very random in general. 
% Our design assumes that there is only one owner per glass, and we can easily 
%extend our scheme to handle the cases with multiple owners. 

***YZ: we need to briefly discuss technical challenges as well. Ashwin, can we get idea from Janne's Mobisys 14 paper? ***

In summary, the key contributions of this paper are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have shown that head-movement patterns can be used to effectively identify a smart wearable device user, with average false acceptance rate of ***\% and average false rejection rate of ***\%. 

\item We have designed the Headbanger system that uses head-movements for authentication for smart wearables. The Headbanger system consists of a set of preprocessing and classification algorithms that can effectively transform raw and noisy sensor data into accurate authentication results. The Headbanger system can further enhance the head-movement based authentication by asking the users to first choose between multiple music tracks.

%\item We have implemented a Java based Headbanger prototype that runs on 
%Google glass. ***

\item We have conducted detailed validation of using head-movement patterns as a biometric characteristic by collecting and analyzing data from multiple users. We will make these data publicly available, which may facilitate other user behavior studies. 
\end{enumerate}

In the sections to follow, we will discuss the background of wearable
device authentication in section~\ref{sec:background} and details of our 
proposed system design in section~\ref{sec:design}. We evaluate the system in 
section~\ref{sec:results} and follow up with discussions and conclusions in 
sections~\ref{sec:disc} and \ref{sec:conc}, respectively.

The recent years have seen a significant growth in popularity of
smart wearable devices. This growth can be attributed to the advances in
hardware miniaturization technology as well as economically affordable
and energy efficient sensing and computing. While size, energy and cost
constraints remain key motives for improvements in wearable computers'
design, the aspect of user authentication has received relatively less
attention. Wearable devices often collect and store sensitive data about
users, and thus there is an obvious need to authenticate the right user to the
device. Solutions today primarily rely on indirect authentication
mechanisms through the user's smartphone, which can be cumbersome and less
secure. Biometric based solutions, though very effective, however, are subject
to the availability of the specific sensors in the wearable unit. In this
paper, we propose to authenticate wearable devices to users based on their
unique behavioral patterns. In particular, we prototype an authentication
system for wearable devices by monitoring user's unique head-movement patterns
in response to an external audio stimulus. Using a personal imaging device as
a running example, and through extensive experimental evaluation over multiple
users, we show that our mechanism can authenticate users with high accuracy
