The recent years have seen a significant growth in popularity of 
wearable devices. This growth can be attributed to the advances in 
hardware miniaturization technology as well as economically affordable 
and energy efficient sensing and computing. While size, energy and cost 
constraints remain key motives for improvements in wearable computers' 
design, the aspect of user authentication has relatively received less 
attention. Wearable devices often collect and store sensitive data about 
users, thus there is an obvious need to authenticate the right owner to the 
device. Solutions today primarily rely on indirect authentication 
mechanisms through the user's smartphone. Biometric based solutions, though 
very effective, however, are subject to the availability of the specific 
sensors in the wearable unit. In this paper, we propose to authenticate 
wearable device to users based on their unique behavioral patterns. In 
particular, we prototype a an authentication system for wearable devices by 
monitoring user's unique body movement patterns in response to an external 
audio stimulus. Using a personal imaging device as a running example and 
through extensive experimental evaluation over multiple users we show 
that our mechanism can authenticate users with an acceptance rate greater than 
95\% while keeping the average false rejection rate below 5\%.
