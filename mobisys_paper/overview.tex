In this work, we propose a design that will enable direct authentication 
of smart-glass users to the device using behavioral biometrics.
In particular, our system, named~\systemname, 
generates signatures from the head-movement patterns of users in response to 
an audio piece played on their device. The audio track is chosen such that
it includes fast beats or rhythm, so that there is significant 
(for generating signatures) natural head-movement.
The head-movement patterns are recorded in the form of 
raw accelerometer signals, which are then processed to generate 
a signature, unique to every user. The system will grant the user access to 
the device only if the signature is in match with the original.
The original signature of the glass user is generated through a 
training phase that is executed when the glass is operated 
by the user for the very first time, and the training data gets
updated upon each use of the device.
