Performance Comparison

1. Gait: ~\cite{gafurov2006biometric} EER  = 7.3 \% 6 normal gait samples are collected. However, the collection period is 20 meters including the acceleration. 
2.Arm: ~\cite{ahmed2015checksum} True Positive rate 91.6\%, False positive rate 5.5\%    execution time 5.7 sec
3. Head:~\cite{rogers2015approach} Balance Accuracy=(TPR + FAR)/2 = 94.4\%, duration 32 sec.


No-feature approach

1. Arm: ~\cite{ahmed2015checksum}, they compare the movement template without extracting feature.
2.  Uwave ~\cite{liu2009uwave}, Arm-based system by Lin Zhong, compare with template, no feature extraction.
