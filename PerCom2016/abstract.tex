\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present the design, implementation and
user studies of a novel approach to authenticate
wearable devices users based on their unique behavioral patterns. We 
prototype an authentication system, dubbed {\em Headbanger} for
head-worn wearable devices by monitoring user's unique head-movement patterns 
in response to an external audio stimulus. 
Solutions today primarily rely on indirect authentication
mechanisms through the user's smartphone, which can be cumbersome and more 
susceptible to adversary intrusions. Biometric solutions, 
are subject to the availability of the specific sensors in the wearable unit. 
Using a head-worn personal imaging device as a running example and
through extensive experimental evaluation with 30 human subjects, we show
that our mechanism can authenticate users with an average acceptance rate of
95.1\% while keeping the average false acceptance rate of 3.9\%.

%The recent years have seen a significant growth in popularity of
%smart wearable devices. This growth can be attributed to the advances in
%hardware miniaturization technology as well as economically affordable
%and energy efficient sensing and computing. While size, energy and cost
%constraints remain key motives for improvements in wearable computers'
%design, the aspect of user authentication has received relatively less
%attention. Wearable devices often collect and store sensitive data about
%users, and thus there is an obvious need to authenticate the right user to the
%device.
