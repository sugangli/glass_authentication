\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:results}

%In this section, we will present our evaluation results of the \systemname. 
We evaluated \systemname~with comprehensive laboratory studies involving 
human subjects. We collected from volunteer participants accelerometer sensor 
readings with Google Glass.
We analyzed these traces offline on a PC.
Our evaluations are primarily aimed at determining the accuracy of detecting 
and differentiating users based on their head-movements, and understand 
the effect of design parameters such as length of the music cue and training 
data-set size, on accuracy. We also measured the response time of our Google 
Glass implementation of \systemname.
Our studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of our 
institution.
%based on profiling the execution time of each key 
%functions associated with \systemname, on the Google Glass device.

%\subsection{Dataset}


\paragraph{Participants}
** LS: need to update these data **
We had total of 30 volunteer participants. The participants list included a total of 19 males and 11 females. 
The average age of the participants was 29.7 years with a standard deviation 
of 9.81 years. The youngest participant was 23 years old while the eldest was 
at 54 years.

\paragraph{Procedure}
Our first experiment setup aimed at emulating the typical usage scenario 
of \systemname~for authentication, where a user conducts head-movements in 
response to a music cue played on the Google Glass device during a login 
attempt. 
%One of the participants executing the experiment trial wearing the 
%Google Glass. %Figure~\ref{fig:setup} shows our experiment setup.
In this experiment, all participants were asked to wear a Google Glass 
device. Participants who originally wore spectacles were asked to remove their
spectacles before conducting the experiment.
The trials were conducted in an academic environment and overseen by one of 
our team members.
The Google Glass ran our data-collection app that played a piece of 
music (music cue) for a specific duration, and recorded the accelerometer 
sensor readings. We conducted these trials for three duration values: 5 s, 
6 s and 10 s. As we will show further, the accuracy of the system can 
significantly improve with the duration of the music cue; longer the duration 
better is the accuracy. 
The sensor readings were recorded into a text file that was stored 
in the Glass's memory and later transported to a PC for offline processing
through a Python script. The experiment was conducted in a well-lit indoor 
academic laboratory environment. 
 
During the course of the experiment, the participants were allowed to take a 
break or withdraw from experimentation if they felt uncomfortable at any 
point; for example, feeling 
dizzy after head-movement for a period of time, not being able to see clearly 
if near-sighted, etcetera. The conductor also allowed the user to take a break 
of about one minute after each experiment trial.
Each trial lasted for the duration of the music cue played on the Glass, and 
a total of 40 such trials were conducted for each of the 30 subjects. 
The experiment lasted over a duration of 60 days, of which 15 
subjects conducted their trials in a single sitting over a period of two 
hours, while the rest of the trails were spread over 3 days on an average per 
subject.
%while, half of the trials of the rest 10 subjects were spread over 2 days.
The experiment yielded three sets of data traces that each correspond to 
the three music cue durations we selected. 

Our second experiment aimed at an practical imitation attack field test scenario. In this experiment, there were three subjects being taken video while they were performing their login movement. The participants were divided into three group, and each group was asked to imitated one of the three users above. During the test, the participants can watch the video for as many time as they want at anytime between two trials. A feedback from our system will be provided after each trail so that the participants can decide whether they need to adjust their movement or not. After total number of trials reached 30 for each participant, the experiment will stop no regardless the participant succeed or not. The investigator was not only recording the total number of successes, but also the number of trail before the first successful login. This experiment is conducted in quite space on campus. We will now discuss our evaluation results for both experiments in detail.

\subsection{Accuracy}
We evaluate the accuracy of \systemname~using metrics that are commonly used 
in evaluating authentication systems, namely,
the false acceptance rate FAR (percentage of false test samples that are 
mistakenly accepted), false rejection rate FRR (percentage of true test 
samples that are mistakenly rejected), and true positive rate 
TPR (percentage of true test samples that are correctly accepted). 
A strict threshold in the classifier can lead to high FRR, while 
overly relaxing the same can lead to a high FAR. Hence, we also consider 
the equal error rate EER (percentage of errors when $FAR = FRR$), that 
considers both FAR and FRR.
%and balanced accuracy BAC, where BAC = 1 - (FAR+FRR)/2.
%We present the accuracy results through the receiver operating 
%characteristics (ROC) curves, TPR versus FAR, as shown in Figures~\ref{} 
%and~\ref{}. 
Figures~\ref{fig:roc-top1}, \ref{fig:roc-top3} and \ref{fig:eer-length} report 
the accuracy 
of \systemname~through the metrics stated above. 
%Figures~\ref{fig:roc-curves} (a)-(c) report the accuracy of 
%\systemname~through the metrics stated above.
In general, our evaluation of the 30 subject data-set indicates that a 
TPR of 95.1\% at FAR of 3.5\%, and EER = 3.97\% can be achieved in 
\systemname, however, these results are tailored to the following parameter 
and algorithm choices:
10 sec music duration, $K = 3$, and 30 (out of 40) trials from each user being 
used for training with a thresholding parameter value $n = 2.7$ with DTW. 
We will now discuss the results and the impact of such parameter choices 
on accuracy in more detail.
\paragraph{Impact of similarity algorithm}
In previous preliminary study, we find that DTW, Cosine Distance, and Correlation are giving promising results for the response time sequence, hence we will evaluate these three algorithms in our end-to-end system. Also due to DTW is relatively more computing-intensive than the other two algorithm, we would like to see whether DTW  is worth of computing resource. In this experiment, we vary thresholding parameter value $n$ and fix the other parameters: 10 sec duration, $K = 1$, and  training data $size = 30$. We can observe from the ROC 
(receiver operating characteristic) curves in Figure~\ref{fig:roc_dtw_cos_cor} that DTW gives the best result among three algorithms, since its curve is the closest to the upper left corner. Our preserves all characteristics of the data, which includes the response time to the music beat and the waveform of 3 axis. In term of matching the waveform of two signal, DTW can achieve significant enhancement than the other two algorithms. 
\paragraph{Impact of music cue duration and $K$ value}

The classification algorithm in \systemname~generates the classification result (YES or NO) by voting among the individual results each generated by the top-K samples in the truing set. We can observe from the ROC curves in Figure~\ref{fig:roc-top1} and \ref{fig:roc-top3} that 
for both, $K=1$ and $K=3$, the TPR is close to 95\% while the FAR is slightly 
above 3\% for the 10 sec music duration. For $K = 1$ the FAR increases to 
about 7\% for the 5 sec and 6 sec cases, however, for $K = 3$ the FAR 
decreases to about 3\% and 4\%, respectively. 
We observe a similar trend with the EER as shown in 
Figure\ref{fig:eer-length}, where improvements of 0.5 - 1 \% 
can be achieved by choosing $K = 3$ over $K = 1$.
This indicates that the accuracy in \systemname~can improve with a larger 
value of $K$. However, the improvement in accuracy through redundancy in the 
training set trades off with the increased execution time as the 
matching requires at least $K - 1$  extra DTW computations as opposed to only 
1 for a top-1 scheme. As we will show ahead, DTW computations incur heavy CPU 
budget on the wearable device. 
%We measure the DTW computation on Google Glass to be the most 
%computationally expensive operation of all the software modules in 
%\systemname.
%\paragraph{Impact of music cue duration}

In general, we observe from the results that the FAR can 
be decreased by increasing the music cue duration. 
We can observe (from Figures~\ref{fig:roc-top1}, \ref{fig:roc-top3} and 
\ref{fig:eer-length}) that the improvement is less significant when the music 
cue duration is increased from 5 sec to 6 sec, however, the improvement is 
more 
significant when the music cue duration is increased to 10 sec. 
In \systemname~the data collection phase for the authentication system 
(sampling accelerometer sensor readings) is executed in parallel with the 
music cue. The data processing phase involving the filtering, classification 
and matching is executed only at the end of the music cue and in the same 
order.
%Hence, execution time of the app will be independent of this duration.
We note that, the data input duration of 5-10 sec for authentication 
may seem long, but in reality, such data input durations are on par with those 
of password based systems~\cite{von2013patterns}.
%We also note that, since the authentication process is initiated only at the 
%end of the music cue, execution time of the app will be independent
%of this duration.

\caption{Comparison of EER for different training sample sizes (30, 20 and 10) 
with fixed n value of 2.7}
\label{fig:eer-size}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Impact of Training set size}
%The accuracy of detecting and matching the head-movements to the user depend 
%upon the music cue duration, value of $K$, and number of samples used for 
%training.
Recalling from \systemname section~\ref{sec:design}, the input to the training phase
is a set of temporal signals (samples with duration equal to the music cue 
duration), each corresponding to one trial of the head-movements from the 
user. Our evaluations so far considered a training set size of 30 samples. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:eer-size}, we report the EER in \systemname~for three 
different training data set sizes; 10,20 and 30 samples.
We can observe from Figure~\ref{fig:eer-size} that the EER holds an inverse 
relationship with the training set size. A larger training set minimizes the 
variance in mean and standard deviation computations, as the errors in their 
inconsistency are reduced by averaging the mean and standard deviation 
estimates over a larger set of data. 
On the other hand, a larger training set also implies a longer execution time 
of the training phase.
However, in our system design, we posit that the training phase can be 
conducted 
offline on a more compute efficient device (smartphone, PC or server) and that 
the wearable device can pre-fetch the trained data (for example, an XML file), 
prior-to or during data collection phase, through a wireless link.

\subsection{Is it Secured?}
We evaluated the vulnerability by conducting a imitation attack experiment. The reason that these three subjects chosen to become imitated subjects is as following: $Subject A$ performed a simple nodding movement by naturally following the music flow. $Subject B$ also performed a simple nodding, but his response to the music beat always delayed for a certain time, hence other people are not easy to follow. $Subject C$ performed a movement combined with nodding and shaking, and he only nodded/shake at certain beats instead of every beat, which makes his movement is relatively difficult to learn. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:imitation},

\subsection{Headbanger Google Glass App Implementation}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics [width=\columnwidth]{figure/software_arch.eps}
\caption{Software modules of \systemname~implementation}
\vspace{25 pt}
\label{fig:glass-softwarearch}
\end{figure}

We implemented \systemname~on Google glass, positioning it as an 
authentication application (app). 
Figure~\ref{fig:glass-softwarearch} shows the main software modules in the 
app. Upon initiation by the user, the app plays a music cue for a stipulated 
duration. The user conducts head-movements in synchrony with the music cue 
while the app records the accelerometer sensor in parallel. At the end of the 
music cue duration the app executes the data processing phase where the 
sensor readings are input to the \systemname's software modules for 
processing. The processing stage includes the filtering of the accelerometer 
sensor values, classification and feature extraction using DTW, and threshold 
based matching of the generated features with those from training set.
%\systemname extracts the head-movement features through 
%the thresholding process discussed in section~\ref{sec:design}, and compare 
%with the feature templates generated from the training phase. 
Upon completion of data processing, the app responds with a YES or NO textual 
output on the Google Glass screen, depending on match score.

In our current implementation, the training phase is conducted offline, prior 
to live-testing off the application.
The training phase involves collecting 30 samples (variable) of the 
head-movement accelerometer readings, generating the features, and saving them 
into a local server (running on PC) as an XML file, with appropriate indexing. 
Upon app initiation on Glass, the trained features are pre-fetched from 
the server through a wireless connection. This ensures that the training set 
is readily available during the authentication process, thus eliminating the 
additional processing time required for the training phase.
Conducting online training, particularly that involves DTW computations, is 
very compute intensive on a resource constrained devices such as Glass. 
One possible solution would be for the Glass to offload the 
training phase computation to a local server machine.
%We reserve such considerations for future implementations.

%Among all the software modules, the ``training set construction model'' is 
%the most computing-intensive, and as a result, we executed the model on the 
%bluetooth-paired smartphone. The rest of the modules are implemented and 
%executed on the glass. 
%In our on-glass app, the classification module runs the 
%thresholding-based classification.

\caption{\label{tab:glass} Measured response time of \systemname~app implementation on Google 
Glass with different music cue durations and for $K = 1$. The response time 
reported here is an average over 20 trials.}

\end{table}

In Table~\ref{tab:glass} we report the measured average response-time 
of the \systemname implementation on Google Glass app for music cue durations 
of 5,6 and 10 seconds. We conducted the benchmark execution-time profiling of 
\systemname~on Glass in a controlled indoor laboratory setting with no 
mobility. We define response time as the time elapsed between music cue 
completion to 
the display of authentication response (YES/NO text) on the Glass screen. 
Our measurements indicate that the response time is within 5 seconds for a 10 
second data input, and is almost halved for a 5 second data input.
We feel that a response time of 2-5 sec for a local authentication solution in 
Google Glass is comparable to that of prior-art that comes close to our 
solution~\cite{von2013patterns,egelman2014you}.
It is also important to note that authentication solutions that execute 
locally on head-worn wearable devices, especially on a heavily resource 
constrained device like Glass, are still not mature. However, the hope is that 
such solutions will possibly catch up to speed in the near future and that our 
approach is advancing one step in that direction. 
In Table~\ref{tab:glass} we also report the execution time of the key 
processes in \systemname; filtering, DTW computation ($K = 1$ requires 1 DTW 
computation), thresholding based similarity matching. 
We can observe from Table~\ref{tab:glass} that the DTW computation 
dramatically compute intensive than the other processes. 

It is important to note that our current implementation uses a faster 
version of the DTW algorithm called Fast DTW~\cite{salvador2007toward}, 
providing about 2x speed-up in DTW computation.
We believe that the response time can be reduced 
further through strategic methods such as, further optimizations in the Fast 
DTW algorithm or pipelining the app execution along with data collection.
A specific strategy for reducing response time for rejected attempts can be 
that, after a short duration, before the entire music cue is played, if it is 
found that a user's movement does not match the signature of the claimed user
with a sufficient pre-determined confidence level, then the on-site 
classification may be terminated instead of waiting for the entire duration to 
yield the rejection.
Another example, may include cyber-foraging strategies to offload heavy
computation tasks, such as online training and classification, to the user's 
Bluetooth paired smartphone or a nearby cloudlet~\cite{ha2014towards}.
