\section{Conclusion}
As wearable devices are gradually integrating into human lives, providing security and privacy protection for these devices becomes critically significant. We have developed a user authentication system, \systemname, for directly authenticating a user to their head--worn device. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed system provides a lightweight and convenient software solution without additional hardware. In this work, we implement and demonstrate the system as a proof--of--concept of direct authentication on head--worn wearable devices through head--movements.
We show the reliability and robustness of the system to imitation attacks.
In future, we aim to test the system at a larger scale with a goal to integrate head--movement based authentication as a fundamental service in wearable devices.

As a future work, it is important to study the impact of different music cues since they are hidden from the attackers in the  casual environment, which can be potentially increase the security of the system. Also, user identification function  can be adapted easily by indexing different users in the device.
